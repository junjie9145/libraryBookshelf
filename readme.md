Created a simple library catalog for The Odin Project. 
In this app I used class and constructors in order to make the book objects instead of using prototype.

This is also my first app in which I used save local. The logic of restoring the JSON string gave me trouble at first.

I'm still having issues trying to implement a check to prevent adding duplicate books. I will update app when I have a solution.
